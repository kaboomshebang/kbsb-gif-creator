## Retrospective

- Use `.bind(this)` in the constructor to set the correct execution context for methods
- References to passed down state don't re-render. `useState` only triggers a re-render with new values. 
- Splitting `useState` in seperate single variables is easier to setup then combining multiple properties in one object/array. (Or maybe I'm unaware of some kind of trick ðŸ¤¨)
- Perhaps only use function-components instead of class-compoents. (So managing state accross components is easier?)
- Using more generic Git branchenames ("add-state-to-components" instead of "add-state-to-export-component") would have worked better when the application is still under construction. Specific feature branches perhaps work better when the application is fully working and new features are smaller.
- Triggering an unmount CSS transition with a `setTimeout` is probably something that can be improved.
